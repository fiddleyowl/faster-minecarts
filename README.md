## Faster Minecarts

This mod aims to balance the speed of vanilla minecarts compared to the other means of transportation available.

If you like the thought of building long railways connecting your world together, but feel that you are hampering yourself because the fastest horse can reach almost double the speed a vanilla minecart can while requiring close to no resources at the same time, then hopefully this mod can remedy that.

This mod increases the maximum speed of all vanilla minecarts from 8 m/s to 30 m/s. Additionally, minecarts will be slowed down automatically around corners to prevent them from derailing at those speeds.

However, sometimes you do want your minecart to slow down (at stations, etc.), so this mod also provides acceleration rail and deceleration rail to *toggle* whether a specific minecart is to accelerate or not.

If you don't like the way to toggle, you can also put a soul sand block under a rail to slow down the minecart manually. Your furnace minecarts will also be automatically slowed down on a hopper.

Everything can be configured in modmenu. Install for better experience!

This mod requires **Fabric**.
